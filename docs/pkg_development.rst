The WaveWatch III¬Æ command processor package, ``WWatch3-Cmd``, provides the ``wwatch3``
command-line tool for doing various operations associated with the Strait of Georgia
configuration of the WAVEWATCH III¬Æ model as it is used in the context of the `MIDOSS project`_.

.. _MIDOSS project: https://midoss-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

.. _WWatch3-CmdPythonVersions:

Python Versions
===============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6+-blue.svg
    :target: https://docs.python.org/3.7/
    :alt: Python Version

The :kbd:`wwatch3_cmd` package is developed and tested using `Python`_ 3.7 or later.
The package uses some Python language features that are not available in versions prior to 3.6,
in particular:

* `formatted string literals`_
  (aka *f-strings*)
* the `file system path protocol`_

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/
.. _formatted string literals: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings
.. _file system path protocol: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep519


.. _WWatch3-CmdGettingTheCode:

Getting the Code
================

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/version%20control-git-blue.svg?logo=github
    :target: https://github.com/MIDOSS/WWatch3-Cmd
    :alt: Git on GitHub

Clone the code and documentation `repository`_ from GitHub with:

.. _repository: https://github.com/MIDOSS/WWatch3-Cmd

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:MIDOSS/WWatch3-Cmd.git

or copy the URI
(the stuff after :kbd:`git clone` above)
from the :guilabel:`Code` button on the `repository`_ page.

.. note::

    The :kbd:`git clone` command above assumes that your are `connecting to GitHub using SSH`_.
    If it fails,
    please follow the instructions in our :ref:`SecureRemoteAccess` docs to set up your SSH keys and :ref:`CopyYourPublicSshKeyToGitHub`.

    .. _connecting to GitHub using SSH: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh


.. _WWatch3-CmdDevelopmentEnvironment:

Development Environment
=======================

The :kbd:`WWatch3-Cmd` package depends on the :kbd:`NEMO-Cmd` package,
so you need to clone the `NEMO-Cmd repo`_
beside your clone of the :kbd:`WWatch3-Cmd` `repository`_.

.. _NEMO-Cmd repo: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-cmd

Setting up an isolated development environment using `Conda`_ is recommended.
Assuming that you have `Miniconda3`_ installed,
you can create and activate an environment called :kbd:`wwatch3-cmd` that will have all of the Python packages necessary for development,
testing,
and building the documentation with the commands below.

.. _Conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/
.. _Miniconda3:  https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd MIDOSS
    $ conda env create -f WWatch3-Cmd/envs/environment-dev.yaml
    $ conda activate wwatch3-cmd
    (wwatch3-cmd)$ python3 -m pip install --editable NEMO-Cmd/
    (wwatch3-cmd)$ python3 -m pip install --editable WWatch3-Cmd/

The :kbd:`--editable` option in the :command:`pip install` command above installs the packages from the cloned repos via symlinks so that the installed packages will be automatically updated as the repos evolve.

To deactivate the environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (wwatch3-cmd)$ conda deactivate


.. _WWatch3-CmdCodingStyle:

Coding Style
============

.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg
    :target: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    :alt: The uncompromising Python code formatter

The :kbd:`WWatch3-Cmd` package uses the `black`_ code formatting tool to maintain a coding style that is very close to `PEP 8`_.

.. _black: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
.. _PEP 8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

:command:`black` is installed as part of the :ref:`WWatch3-CmdDevelopmentEnvironment` setup.

To run :command:`black` on the entire code-base use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd WWatch3-Cmd
    $ conda activate wwatch3_cmd
    (wwatch3-cmd)$ black ./

in the repository root directory.
The output looks something like::

  reformatted /media/doug/warehouse/MIDOSS/WWatch3-Cmd/docs/conf.py
  All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
  1 file reformatted, 3 files left unchanged.


.. _WWatch3-CmdBuildingTheDocumentation:

Building the Documentation
==========================

.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/wwatch3-cmd/badge/?version=latest
    :target: https://wwatch3-cmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    :alt: Documentation Status

The documentation for the :kbd:`WWatch3-Cmd` package is written in `reStructuredText`_ and converted to HTML using `Sphinx`_.

.. _reStructuredText: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html
.. _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

If you have write access to the `repository`_ on GitHub,
whenever you push changes to GitHub the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://wwatch3-cmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Additions,
improvements,
and corrections to these docs are *always* welcome.

The quickest way to fix typos, etc. on existing pages is to use the :guilabel:`Edit on GitHub` link in the upper right corner of the page to get to the online editor for the page on `GitHub`_.

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/MIDOSS/WWatch3-Cmd

For more substantial work,
and to add new pages,
follow the instructions in the :ref:`WWatch3-CmdDevelopmentEnvironment` section above.
In the development environment you can build the docs locally instead of having to push commits to GitHub to trigger a `build on readthedocs.org`_ and wait for it to complete.
Below are instructions that explain how to:

.. _build on readthedocs.org: https://readthedocs.org/projects/wwatch3-cmd/builds/

* build the docs with your changes,
  and preview them in Firefox

* check the docs for broken links


.. _WWatch3-CmdBuildingAndPreviewingTheDocumentation:

Building and Previewing the Documentation
-----------------------------------------

Building the documentation is driven by the :file:`docs/Makefile`.
With your :kbd:`wwatch3-cmd` environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (wwatch3-cmd)$ (cd docs && make clean html)

to do a clean build of the documentation.
The output looks something like::

  Removing everything under '_build'...
  Running Sphinx v2.2.0
  making output directory... done
  building [mo]: targets for 0 po files that are out of date
  building [html]: targets for 5 source files that are out of date
  updating environment: [new config] 5 added, 0 changed, 0 removed
  reading sources... [100%] subcommands
  looking for now-outdated files... none found

  copying static files... ... done
  copying extra files... done
  dumping search index in English (code: en)... done
  dumping object inventory... done
  build succeeded.

  The HTML pages are in _build/html.

The HTML rendering of the docs ends up in :file:`docs/_build/html/`.
You can open the :file:`index.html` file in that directory tree in your browser to preview the results of the build.

If you have write access to the `repository`_ on GitHub,
whenever you push changes to Bitbucket the documentation is automatically re-built and rendered at https://wwatch3-cmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.


.. _WWatch3-CmdLinkCheckingTheDocumentation:

Link Checking the Documentation
-------------------------------

Sphinx also provides a link checker utility which can be run to find broken or redirected links in the docs.
With your :kbd:`wwatch3-cmd)` environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (wwatch3-cmd))$ cd WWatch3-Cmd)/docs/
    (wwatch3-cmd)) docs$ make linkcheck

The output looks something like::

  loading pickled environment... done
  building [mo]: targets for 0 po files that are out of date
  building [linkcheck]: targets for 5 source files that are out of date
  updating environment: 0 added, 1 changed, 0 removed

.. _WWatch3-CmdRunningTheUnitTests:

Running the Unit Tests
======================

The test suite for the :kbd:`WWatch3-Cmd` package is in :file:`WWatch3-Cmd/tests/`.
The `pytest`_ tool is used for test parametrization and as the test runner for the suite.

.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

With your :kbd:`wwatch3-cmd` development environment activated,
use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (wwatch3-cmd)$ cd WWatch3-Cmd/
    (wwatch3-cmd)$ py.test

to run the test suite.
The output looks something like::

  =========================== test session starts ===========================
  platform linux -- Python 3.7.3, pytest-5.1.2, py-1.8.0, pluggy-0.13.0
  rootdir: /media/doug/warehouse/MIDOSS/WWatch3-Cmd
