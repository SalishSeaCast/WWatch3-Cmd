  usage: wwatch3 [--version] [-v | -q] [--log-file LOG_FILE] [-h] [--debug]

  WaveWatch III® Command Processor

  optional arguments:
    --version            show program's version number and exit
    -v, --verbose        Increase verbosity of output. Can be repeated.
    -q, --quiet          Suppress output except warnings and errors.
    --log-file LOG_FILE  Specify a file to log output. Disabled by default.
    -h, --help           Show help message and exit.
    --debug              Show tracebacks on errors.

  Commands:
    complete       print bash completion command (cliff)
    gather         Gather results from a NEMO run. (NEMO-Cmd)
    help           print detailed help for another command (cliff)
    run            Prepare, execute, and gather results from a WaveWatch III® model run.

For details of the arguments and options for a sub-command use
:command:`wwatch3 help <sub-command>`.
For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wwatch3 help run

::

  usage: wwatch3 run [-h] [--no-submit] [-q] [--start-date START_DATE]
                     [--n-days N_DAYS]
                     DESC_FILE WALLTIME RESULTS_DIR

  Prepare, execute, and gather the results from a WaveWatch III® run described
  in DESC_FILE. The results files from the run are gathered in RESULTS_DIR. If
  RESULTS_DIR does not exist it will be created.

  positional arguments:
    DESC_FILE             run description YAML file
    WALLTIME              HPC batch job walltime for the run; formatted as
                          HH:MM:SS
    RESULTS_DIR           directory to store results into

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --no-submit           Prepare the temporary run directory, and the bash
                          script to
                          execute the WaveWatch III® run, but don't submit the
                          run to the queue.
                          This is useful during development runs when you want
                          to hack on
                          the bash script and/or use the same temporary run
                          directory
                          more than once.
    -q, --quiet           don't show the run directory path or job submission
                          message
    --start-date START_DATE
                          Date to start run execution on. Use YYYY-MM-DD format.
                          Defaults to 2019-10-14.
    --n-days N_DAYS       Number of days of runs to execute in the batch job.
                          Defaults to 1.

If a sub-command prints an error message,
you can get a Python traceback containing more information about the error by re-running the command with the :kbd:`--debug` flag.


.. _wwatch3-run:

:kbd:`run` Sub-command
======================

The :command:`run` sub-command prepares,
executes,
and gathers the results from the WaveWatch III® run described in the run description YAML file provided on the command-line.
The results are gathered in the results directory that is also provided on the command-line.

::

  usage: wwatch3 run [-h] [--no-submit] [-q] [--start-date START_DATE]
                     [--n-days N_DAYS]
                     DESC_FILE WALLTIME RESULTS_DIR

  Prepare, execute, and gather the results from a WaveWatch III® run described
  in DESC_FILE. The results files from the run are gathered in RESULTS_DIR. If
  RESULTS_DIR does not exist it will be created.

  positional arguments:
    DESC_FILE             run description YAML file
    WALLTIME              HPC batch job walltime for the run; formatted as
                          HH:MM:SS
    RESULTS_DIR           directory to store results into

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --no-submit           Prepare the temporary run directory, and the bash
                          script to
                          execute the WaveWatch III® run, but don't submit the
                          run to the queue.
                          This is useful during development runs when you want
                          to hack on
                          the bash script and/or use the same temporary run
                          directory
                          more than once.
    -q, --quiet           don't show the run directory path or job submission
                          message
    --start-date START_DATE
                          Date to start run execution on. Use YYYY-MM-DD format.
                          Defaults to 2019-10-14.
    --n-days N_DAYS       Number of days of runs to execute in the batch job.
                          Defaults to 1.

If the :command:`run` sub-command prints an error message,
you can get a Python traceback containing more information about the error by re-running the command with the :kbd:`--debug` flag.

For single day runs,
the :kbd:`RESULTS_DIR` command-line argument should be the directory in which the run results are to be stored,
for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    wwatch3 run 07jan15.yaml 00:15:00 $SCRATCH/MIDOSS/forcing/wwatch3/07jan15 --start-date 2015-01-07

For multi-day runs,
the :kbd:`RESULTS_DIR` command-line argument should be the directory in which the *run results directories are to be created*,
for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    wwatch3 run 07-08jan15.yaml 00:30:00 $SCRATCH/MIDOSS/forcing/wwatch3/ --start-date 2015-01-07 --n-days 2

In both cases,
the run results directory(ies) will be created by the :command:`wwatch3 run` command if they don't already exist.


.. _wwatch3-gather:

:kbd:`gather` Sub-command
=========================

The :command:`gather` sub-command moves results from a WaveWatch III® run into a results directory.
It is provided by the `NEMO-Cmd`_ package.
Please use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wwatch3 help gather

to see its usage,
and see :ref:`nemocmd:nemo-gather` for more details.

.. _NEMO-Cmd: https://bitbucket.org/salishsea/nemo-cmd

If the :command:`gather` sub-command prints an error message,
you can get a Python traceback containing more information about the error by re-running the command with the :kbd:`--debug` flag.
